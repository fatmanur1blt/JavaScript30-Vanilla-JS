I avoided using `keyCode` event because this event has been deprecated. 
<br/> 
* For Other Events :point_right:  [web3school/keyboard events](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_keyboardevent.asp) 
<br/> 
Then I used the code event. For the code event, I need the code of the key that triggered the event. I chose the numbers 1,2,3..8,9. Numbers of code keys Digit 1...Digit 9. I have included these numbers. When the keys are pressed, the background changes with css and the sound specified with the same key numbers that I typed into the audio and div tag comes out.
